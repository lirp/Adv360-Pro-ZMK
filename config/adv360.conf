# My adv360 seems to have debounce issues; these settings should improve them.
# The default debounce delay for pressing and releasing is 5ms. Bump the
# delays to remove any switching glitches observed with the defaults while
# still allowing for an inhuman level of mashing.
# Glitches were observed with 5/5 and 5/12; now trying 6/18.
